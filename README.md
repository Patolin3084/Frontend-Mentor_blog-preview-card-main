## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned a lot more about how to sort elements with flexbox, but I still need a lot of practice with this.

### Continued development

I need a lot of help to make my designs responsive, it is still a problem for me.
I have managed to get the hover to work but not the focus, I'm not sure I'm using it correctly.

### Useful resources

This exercise helped me put into practice my first knowledge in WEB development and is very suitable for a learner who is at my level.
